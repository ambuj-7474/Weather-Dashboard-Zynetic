# Weather-Dashboard
A responsive React.js app using OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather. Search a city to see temperature (Â°C), condition, humidity, wind speed, and icon on a sleek card. Styled with Tailwind CSS, it handles loading/errors with React Hooks. Optional: recent searches, 5-day forecast, theme toggle. Mobile/desktop-ready, modular code.

I have saved the code files in master branch.
